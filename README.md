# Cakefest 2024 Workshop 1 contents

We'll use this repo as a reference for the https://cakefest.org workshop 1 contents.

The finished code is under branch workshop1.

Slides are here > https://speakerdeck.com/steinkel/cakefest-2024-workshop-1 

The file https://github.com/steinkel/cakefest2024/blob/master/step-by-step.md contains the step by step we are going to follow in the workshop session to skip most if the typing.

We are going to build together a plugin from scratch.

The plugin will interact with the main example database. There is a db.sql file we'll use to quickly bake an example application to play with.

Comments and questions are welcome!

Thank you.
